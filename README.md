VERMIN TOURNEY HELPER:

made with python v. 3.5.1


This project is a real piece of shit, expect bugs
It will 
	randomly select how ever many vermin from all vermin in a post rush
	automatically extract and crop vermin/blast/other sprites and save them as seperate images
	save the vermins names, stats, tourney progress, team names and image filenames in 3 csv files (bracketData.csv, metaBracketData.csv, teamNames.csv)
	create and populate an image of the tourney bracket   
	allow the user to enter in team names and update the bracket with team names
	allow the user to pick the winner(s) from a bout and will automatically update the bracket with the winner advancing

INSTRUCTIONS:
	Starting up a tournamnet:
		1. download all vermin images from the postrush, give them their own directory (make sure that all vermin are .pngs and that the only .pngs in this directory are vermin)
		2. move the vermintourneyhelper folder to this directory
		3.
